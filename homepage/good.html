                    Sam Bao is a 4th year computer science undergrad currently churning out his final days at University of Alberta, Canada.<br />
                    For the past few years, Sam has seen himself in a number of different classes from compsci, math, and arts.<br />
                    This guy started at UofA thinking he will end up as a big shot game developer, never in his life has he ever been more certain about that career path than now. <br />

        <h2> What I've done</h2>
        <p name="done">
            Sam wanted to be a game developer, not a programmer. He had being working on the different skillsets required to put a game together.<br />
            Before his time in the University, Sam has already started venturing in the field of 3D Modeling and Animation. He honed his skill in C++ and Python during highschool.<br />
            Unversity showed Sam the two extreme niches in programming: the logic that goes into writing code, and the assembly code that gets translated into machine code from Sam's work.<br />
            Thanks to these courses, Sam understood cpu isn't invincible and has since grown an appreciation for writing efficient code. Sam has also spent some more time praticing his graphic skills, for both Photoshop and 3DSMAX. <br />
            Building software is a team effort, and that will be the most important thing Sam will get out of his degree. Over the past few years Sam has managed, and been managed in numerous projects both in and outside of class. <br />
            Projects are nice, but everyone can agree they preferr being paid for what they do. Which was why Sam ditched a whole semester of school to go coding in a local buisness.<br />
            There, Sam found something more than just money, something he never experinced before: his co-worker actually appreciated what he did. That his work made someone's lives easier. <br />
            By the end of last year, Sam has finally gotten the oppertunity he has being waiting for. A chance to round up folks to make games with him! In the name of school and grades! <br />
            Now that Sam has gotten a taste of putting soemthing that resembles a game in school. Sam is currently working on pulling off his biggest gig yet - <a href="https://github.com/sam9116/workshop_mod">His own game!</a> <br />
        </p>
        <h2> Why I do what I do</h2>
        <p name="do">
            If the Sam's previous rant about his life haven't explained enough about what he does. He will go in detail in this section.<br />
            Through his observation of industry and market trends. Sam understand the best shot for him to make a buck off of writing software is still targeting paying customers on commercial grade platforms. <br />
            The tales of Steam sales milking people's wallet dry has evolved from myth to facts to internet memes. And just like years before, underaged kids are still dragging their parents into game shops to buy games rated for mature audiences. <br />
            That's what he will do. All the different things that it takes to put a game together. Starting from every verticies of a 3D model,every pixel on a 2D texture, every degree of movement of an Animation, every line of code that defines a game object, to every person he works with. <br />
            And that, <br />
            is what he can do. <br />
            Sam did not go to University to write the next great operating system or researching for the next great algorithm that will help find cure for cancer. <br />
            He just wanted to make games.<br />
            And that cause is no less worthy than anything the University has tried to drill into him. <br />

        <h2>The not so <span>fine</span> print</h2>
        <p name="#prints">
            Things Sam discovered that are important over the past few years:<br />
            Talk less, do more. If arround people that talk more and do less, leave.<br />
            Be humble. Be nice. It's like the grease that keeps gears from jamming.<br />
            Check for errors after work is done. People like it when things work. <br />
            People's attention span are short, only ask for their attention when absolutely sure things work.<br />
            It is important to help people, it is also important to know the difference between being helpful and being used.<br />

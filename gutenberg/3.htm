<P class="drop-cap">THIS curious bird has several local names. It is called the
 "stake-driver," "booming bittern," and "thunder-pumper," in consequence of its 
peculiar cry. It was once thought that this noise was made by using a hollow 
reed, but the peculiar tone is possibly due to the odd shaped neck of the bird. 
Gibson says you hear of the stake-driver but can not find his "stake."</P>
<P>We have never seen a bittern except along water courses. He is a solitary
 bird. When alarmed by the approach of someone the bird sometimes escapes
 recognition by standing on its short tail motionless with its bill pointing
 skyward, in which position, aided by its dull coloring, it personates a small
 snag or stump or some other growth about it.</P>
<P>This bird has long legs, yellow green in color, which trail awkwardly behind
 it and serve as a sort of rudder when it flies. It has a long, crooked neck, 
and lengthy yellow bill edged with black. The body is variable as to size, but
 sometimes is said to measure thirty-four inches. The tail is short and rounded. 
In color this peculiar bird is yellowish brown mottled with various shades of 
brown above, and below buff, white and brown.</P>
<P>It is not a skillful architect, but places its rude nest on the ground, in
 which may be found three to five grayish brown eggs.</P>
<P>The habitat of the American bittern covers the whole of temperate and
 tropical North America, north to latitude about 60 degrees, south to Guatemala,
 Cuba, Jamaica and the Bermudas. It is occasionally found in Europe.</P>
<P>Frank Forrester included the bittern among the list of his game birds, and it 
is asked what higher authority we can have than his. The flesh is regarded as 
excellent food.</P>

LITTLE GUESTS IN FEATHERS.</H2>
<P class="ac">NELLY HART WOODWORTH.</P>
<DIV><IMG class="drop-cap" alt="" src="3_files/initial_a.jpg"> </DIV>
<P class="drop-cap">A BROOKLYN naturalist who gives much time to bird-study told
 me that as his rooms became overfull of birds he decided to thin them out 
before the approach of winter. Accordingly he selected two song sparrows and 
turned one of them adrift, thinking to let the other go the next morning.</P>
<P>The little captive was very happy for a few hours, flying about the "wild
 garden" in the rear of the house—a few square rods where more than 400
 varieties of native plants were growing. It was not long, however, before a
 homesick longing replaced the new happiness and the bird returned to the cage 
which was left upon the piazza roof.</P>
<P>The next morning the second sparrow was given his freedom. Nothing was seen 
of him for a week, when he came to the window, beat his tired wings against the 
pane, and sank down upon the window sill so overjoyed at finding himself at home 
that he was fairly bursting with song. His throat trembled with the ecstasy; the 
feathers ruffling as the melody rose from his heart and deluged the air with 
sweetness. His joy was too complete for further experiment.</P>
<P>The first sparrow was again released only to return at nightfall and go
 promptly to bed at the general retiring hour.</P>
<P>This hour, by the way, varied indefinitely; the whole aviary accommodating
 their hours to those of their master, rising with him and settling for the
 night as he turned off the gas. After this same bird was repeatedly sent out,
 like Noah's dove, coming home at evening, till after many days it came no 
more—an implicit confidence in the rightness of all intention doubtless making 
it an easy prey to some evil design.</P>
<P>A handsome hermit thrush from the same aviary, domesticated in my room, after 
an hour or two "abroad" is as homesick for his cage as is a child for its 
mother.</P>
<P>When this bird came into my possession his open and discourteous disapproval
 of women was humiliating. His attitude was not simply endurance but open 
revolt, a deep-rooted hatred for the entire sex. When, after long weeks of 
acquaintance, this hostility was overcome he followed me about the room, stood 
beside me at my work, and has since been unchanging in a pathetic devotion.</P>
<P>He plants his tiny feet in my pen-tray and throws the pens upon the floor. He 
stands on tiptoe before the mirror, staring with curious eyes at the strange 
rival till awe is replaced by anger and the brown wings beat in unavailing
 effort to reach the insolent mimic. When shown a worm he trembles in excited 
anticipation, his little feet dancing upon the floor, his wings moving rapidly, 
while he utters a coaxing, entreating syllable. The song is sweetest when 
raindrops fall or when the room is noisy and confused. I notice, too, that he is 
more tuneful before a rain.</P>
<P>I must confess that he keeps late hours, that he is often busy getting
 breakfast when orthodox birds should be dreaming, his active periods being
 liable to fall at any hour of the night, more especially if there be a moon. An 
intensely sentimental nature may be unable to sleep when the beauty of the world 
is so strongly emphasized.</P>
<P>His last frolic was with a frog the children smuggled into the house, chasing 
it around the room, darting at it with wide-open beak, advancing and retreating 
in a frenzied merriment.</P>
<P>As the cage door is often left open he is sometimes "lost" briefly. At one of 
these times I decided that he had gone to sleep under the bed and would be quite 
safe till morning. Before day-light my mother called to me from the next room 
that there was "something in her bed," and, sure enough, the truant <SPAN class="pagenum"><A 
name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</A></SPAN> stood upon her pillow, his 
wings almost brushing her face.</P>
<P>The song of an indigo bird, kept in my room, is often followed by from two to 
four subdued notes of exceeding richness and sweetness. Aside from the ordinary 
song, sometimes reduced to the syllables, "meet, meet, I'll meet you," words 
unheard save by aid of a vivid imagination, the bird has an exquisite warble, 
loud and exhilarating, as rounded and velvety as the bluebird's.</P>
<P>When the bird became familiar with the room, its occupants and the sunshine
 streaming in through the window, his happiness crystallized in song, a rarely 
beautiful strain unheard before. The feathers on his throat would ruffle as a 
wave of song ran upward filling the room with a delicious music.</P>
<P>Unlike the hermit thrush, which has silent, preoccupied hours and is given to 
meditation, the indigo has no indolent days and is a happy, sunny-hearted
 creature.</P>
<P>His attitudes are like the catbird's—erecting crest, flirting body and tail, 
or drooping the latter in the precise manner of the catbird. Judged by indigo
 dress-standards, this bird is in an undress uniform, quite as undress as it is
 uniform; as somebody says, a result of the late moult.</P>
<P>For all this his changeable suit is not only becoming, but decidedly 
modern—warp of blue and woof of green that change with changing light from 
indigo to intense emerald. Then there are browns and drabs in striking 
contrasts—colors worn by indigoes while young and inexperienced, the confused
 shades of the upper breast replaced by sparrowy stripes beneath.</P>
<P>My bird is a night singer, pouring out his tuneful plaint as freely in the
 "wee, sma' hours," as when the sun is shining; its notes as sweet as if he knew 
that if we <I>must</I> sing a night song it should be sweet that some heart may
 hear and be the better for our singing. Later in the day a purple finch in the
 cedar tangle challenged the vocalist in notes so entrancing that one's breath
 was hushed involuntarily.</P>
<P>The same finch sang freely during the entire season in notes replete with 
personality, a distinct translation of the heart language. Others might sing and 
sing, but this superb voice rose easily above them all, a warbling, gurgling,
 effervescing strain, finished and polished in notes of infinite tenderness.
 Short conversations preceded and followed the musical ecstasy, a love song
 intended for one ear only, while wings twinkled and fluttered in rhythm with
 the pulsing heart of the melodist. No doubt he was telling of a future castle
 in the air beside which castles in Spain are of little value.</P>

ORIGIN OF THE EASTER EGG.</H2>
<P class="ac">ELANORA KINSLEY MARBLE.</P>
<DIV><IMG class="drop-cap" alt="" src="3_files/initial_n.jpg"> </DIV>
<P class="drop-cap">NOW is the time of year when we feel called upon to inform 
our readers that the peacock does not lay the pretty colored Easter eggs.</P>
<P>This valuable bit of information the great American humorist feels called
 upon to make year after year, and though we elder folk smile, and the young 
query, how many of us are familiar with the history of the custom of observing 
the closing of Lent with the egg feast?</P>
<P>One must go back to the Persians for the first observance of the egg day.
 According to one of the ancient cosmogonies, all things were produced from an 
egg, hence called the mundane egg. This cosmogony was received in Persia, and on 
this account there obtained, among the people of that country, a custom of 
presenting each other with an egg, the symbol of a new beginning of time on 
every New Year's day; that is, on the day when the sun enters Aries, the 
Persians reckoning the beginning of the new year from that day, which occurred 
in March. The doctrine of the mundane egg was not confined to the limits of 
Persia, but was spread, together with the practice of presenting New Year's
 eggs, through various other countries. But the New Year was not kept on the day 
when the sun enters Aries, or at least it ceased, in process of time, to be so 
kept. In Persia itself the introduction of the Mohammedan faith brought with it 
the removal of New Year's day.</P>
<P>Among the Jews the season of the ancient New Year became that of the
 Passover, and among the Christians the season of the Passover has become that 
of Easter. Among all these changes the custom of giving an egg at the sun's 
entrance into Aries still prevails. The egg has also continued to be held as a 
symbol, and the sole alteration is the prototype. At first it was said to be the 
beginning of time and now it is called the symbol of the resurrection. One sees, 
therefore, what was the real origin of the Easter egg of the Greek and Roman 
churches.</P>
<P>From a book entitled "An Extract from the Ritual of Pope Paul V.," made for 
Great Britain, it appears that the paschal egg is held by the Roman church to be 
an emblem of the resurrection, and that it is made holy by a special blessing of 
a priest.</P>
<P>In Russia Easter day is set apart for paying visits. The men go to each
 other's house in the morning and introduce themselves by saying "Christ is 
arisen." The answer is "Yes, he is risen!" Then they embrace, exchange eggs, and 
sad to relate, drink a great deal of brandy.</P>
<P>An account of far older date says, "Every year against Easter day, the
 Russians color or dye red with Brazil wood a great number of eggs, of which
 every man and woman giveth one unto the priest of the parish upon Easter day in 
the morning. And, moreover, the common people carry in their hands one of these 
red eggs, not only upon Easter day but also three or four days after. And 
gentlewomen and gentlemen have eggs gilded, which they carry in like manner. 
They use the eggs, as they say, for a great love and in token of the 
resurrection whereof they rejoice. For when two friends meet during the Easter 
holidays, they come and take one another by the hand; the one of them saith,
 'The Lord, our Christ, is risen!' The other answereth, 'It is so of a truth!'
 Then they kiss and exchange their eggs, both men and women continuing in 
kissing four days together."</P>
<P>There is an old English proverb on the subject of Easter eggs, namely: "I'll 
warrant you an egg for Easter." In some parts of England, notably in the north, 
the eggs are colored by means of dyeing drugs, in which the eggs are boiled. 
These eggs are called "paste" eggs, also "pace" and "pasche," all derived from 
"pascha"—Easter.</P>

<H2><A name="MORAL_VALUE_OF_FORESTS" id="MORAL_VALUE_OF_FORESTS"></A>  MORAL 
VALUE OF FORESTS.</H2>
<DIV><IMG class="drop-cap" alt="" src="3_files/initial_a.jpg"> </DIV>
<P class="drop-cap">A COMPARATIVELY untouched phase of the question of forest
 destruction is brought out in a book called "North American Forests and 
Forestry," by Ernest Bruncken, a prominent western forester. The author 
incidentally discusses the part which our forests have had in shaping American 
character and our national history. This phase of the matter is interesting both 
as a historical study and as a suggestion of the moral as well as economic loss
 which must come with the denudation of our forest areas.</P>
<P>All thinking Americans know that the forests are an important factor in our 
commercial life, and Mr. Bruncken makes an impressive statement of the way in 
which the lumber industry permeates all the nation's activities. But the part 
played by the vast primeval forests in creating American character is not so 
generally realized. From the earliest colonial times the forests have had a 
moral and political effect in shaping our history. In the seventeenth century 
England was dependent upon Norway and the Baltic provinces for its timber for 
ships. This was in various ways disadvantageous for England, so the American 
colonists were encouraged with bounties to cut ship timbers, masts and other 
lumber for European export. This trade, however, was found to be unprofitable on
 account of the long ocean voyage, so the American lumbermen began to develop a 
profitable market in the West Indies. This was straightway interdicted by the 
short-sighted British government, and the bitter and violent opposition of the 
colonists against this tyrannical policy ceased only with the end of British 
dominion.</P>
<P>From that time to the present the forests of America have exercised a most 
important influence upon the nation, especially in creating the self-reliance
 which is the chief trait of the American character. The trappers, hunters, 
explorers and backwoods settlers who went forth alone into the dense forests 
received a schooling such as nothing else could give. As the forest closed 
behind the settler he knew his future and that of his family must henceforth 
depend upon himself, his ax, his rifle, and the few simple utensils he had 
brought with him. It was a school that did not teach the graces, but it made men 
past masters in courage, pertinacity, and resourcefulness. It bred a new, 
simple, and forceful type of man. Out of the midst of that backwoods life came 
Abraham Lincoln, the greatest example of American statesmanship the nation has 
produced. In him was embodied all the inherent greatness of his early wilderness
 surroundings, with scarcely a trace of its coarser characteristics.</P>
<P>As Mr. Bruncken says, mere remembrance of what the forests have given us in 
the past should be enough to inspire a wish to preserve them as long as 
possible, to stop wanton waste by forest fires, and even to repair our losses by 
planting new forests, as they do in Europe. The time has gone when the silence 
and dangers of the forest were our chief molders of sturdy character, but it is 
undeniable that the pioneer blood that still runs so richly in American veins 
has much to do with causing the idea of Philippine expansion to appeal so 
powerfully to the popular imagination. The prophets who see in the expansion 
idea the downfall of the nation forget that the same spirit subdued the American 
wilderness and created the freest government and some of the finest specimens of 
manhood the world has ever seen.</P>

<P class="drop-cap">IBISES are distributed throughout the warmer parts of the 
globe and number, according to the best authorities, about thirty species, of 
which four occur in North America. The scarlet ibis is a South American species, 
though it has been recorded from Florida, Louisiana, and New Mexico. The ibises 
are silent birds, and live in flocks during the entire year. They feed along the 
shores of lakes, bays, and salt-water lagoons, and on mud flats, over which the 
tide rises and falls. Their food consists of crustaceans, frogs, and small 
fish.</P>
<P>Colonies of ibises build nests in reedy marshes, or in low trees and bushes 
not far from good feeding-grounds. Three to five pale greenish eggs, marked with 
chocolate, are found in the coarse, bulky nest of reeds and weed stalks.</P>
<P>These birds are not so numerous as they once were. They have been wantonly
 destroyed for their plumage alone, the flesh being unfit for food.</P>

CHIPPY—A BABY MOCKING BIRD.</H2>
<P class="ac">MARTHA CROMBIE WOOD.</P>
<DIV><IMG class="drop-cap" alt="" src="3_files/initial_o.jpg"> </DIV>
<P class="drop-cap">ONE bright day early in August I sat by my window writing. 
My attention was soon attracted by a pair of mocking birds which were flying 
back and forth between a peach-tree and a plum-tree near by.</P>
<P>These birds having been near neighbors of mine for some time, I had named
 them Jack and Jill.</P>
<P>A family quarrel seemed brewing, for Jack evidently found more good points in 
the plum-tree and scolded Jill for spending any time in the peach-tree, while 
Jill was equally impressed with the favorable aspect of the peach-tree. I 
thought they were trying to decide upon a location for a nest and was soon
 convinced that I was right, for Jack ended the family disagreement by taking a 
twig in his bill and carrying it to the plum-tree, where he began balancing it 
among some of the small branches. His mate continued to scold from her place in 
the peach-tree, but when he paid no attention to her and went on with his work 
she soon relented and flew down to offer her assistance.</P>
<P>With very little difficulty these birds could carry a twig six or eight 
inches long and a quarter of an inch in diameter. Several of these large twigs 
were laid loosely among the forks of three small branches and then a more 
compact structure was placed upon this foundation. This was made of smaller
 twigs, with roots and stems of Bermuda grass twisted among them. A lining
 composed of horse hair, grass, cotton, a piece of satin ribbon some three
 inches long, bits of paper, string and rag completed the home.</P>
<P>There was very little weaving in the construction of the nest and the most
 wonderful as well as the most curious thing about it was how it could be made
 so loosely and not fall apart during the very high winds which we have in 
central Texas.</P>
<P>While the eggs were being hatched there was a violent storm which lasted all 
day, and several times I saw the tree bend nearly to the ground. Each time I was 
afraid I should see the destruction of this home, which had become so
 interesting to me. As I watched the tree writhe in the storm I began to 
appreciate the wisdom shown by the bird in the selection of the place for his 
nest, for it was in the part of the tree least disturbed by the wind and most 
thoroughly protected from the rain.</P>
<P>During the long nights the mocking bird often sang to his mate as she 
patiently sat on the nest.</P>
<P><SPAN class="pagenum"><A name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 
156]</A></SPAN></P>
<P>Nothing can be more delightful than the song of our mocking birds, heard when 
the moonlight makes the night almost as light as the day and the south wind is 
ladened with the delicious odors of roses and honeysuckle.</P>
<P>At last the eggs were hatched and five baby birds demanded food. The parent 
birds worked constantly from dawn till dark, but, from the loud 
"<I>ce-ce-ce</I>" which greeted them each time they neared the nest, one might 
suppose the supply of food never equaled the demand.</P>
<P>A young mocking bird seems all mouth and legs. He is a comical little
 creature with his scant covering of gray down, long legs, large feet and
 ever-open mouth, with its lining of bright orange.</P>
<P>As the old bird approaches the little ones squat flat in the nest, throw back
 their heads and open their enormous mouths, which must seem like so many
 bottomless pits to the parent birds when they are tired.</P>
<P>If my favorite cat, Mephistopheles, tried to take his nap anywhere in the
 vicinity of their nest Jack and Jill would fly at him, screaming, and, boldly
 lighting upon his head, try to peck at his eyes. He would strike at them and
 spit, but they would only fly upon the fence or rose-trellis and in a moment
 dart at him again. The battle would continue until Mephistopheles retired to a 
safer place.</P>
<P>I have seen many such battles, but never one where the bird was not 
victorious.</P>
<P>One morning, when the birds were still quite small, one of them tumbled from 
the nest. At first I thought the mother-bird might have pushed it out that it 
might learn to fly, but after seeing the feathers of its wings had only reached 
the tiny pin-feather stage, I knew it was too young for such efforts and 
concluded that the nest was overcrowded. I tried to put it in the nest for it 
was drenched with the dew from the grass.</P>
<P>Jack and Jill objected so seriously to my assistance that I had to give up
 this plan, for they flew at me just as they did at Mephistopheles. Fearing the 
cat would hurt it I was compelled to take it into the house.</P>
<P>Then my troubles began. It seemed to take all of my time to feed this one
 bird, and I could not imagine how Jack and Jill could take care of it and four
 others.</P>
<P>For awhile it seemed very much frightened, but at length began to chirp. The 
old birds answered at once and soon came to the screen on the window and called 
to it. Knowing they would feed it if they could reach it I had to keep it away 
from them, for, should they discover it was a prisoner, they would give it 
poison.</P>
<P>We named it Chippy and it soon became a great pet. Whenever anyone entered 
the room where it was its mouth flew open, and from its shrill 
"<I>chee-chee-chee</I>," one might easily imagine it was on the verge of 
starvation.</P>
<P>When I had had it a week it would try to fly from the floor to the lower
 rounds of a chair. When it had learned to fly, if left alone it would call 
until someone answered, and then follow the sound until it found them. I have
 known it to fly through two rooms, a downstairs hall, up the stair-steps,
 through the upper hall, and into my room in response to my whistle.</P>
<P>When it first made this journey it could fly only two or three feet at a time 
and had to fly from step to step up the stairway.</P>
<P>Soon after this I took Chippy out of doors. He was very much delighted when 
placed in a young hackberry tree, where he could fly from branch to branch. When 
he reached the top of the tree Jill flew into a tree near by and tried to coax 
him to come to her. I saw Chippy spread his wings and supposed I had lost my 
pet. Imagine my surprise when he gave a shrill scream and flew straight to me, 
lighting on my shoulder and nestling against my face.</P>
<P>Jill followed him, resting in a vine some three or four feet from me. When
 coaxing failed she flew away but soon returned with a grasshopper in her 
bill.</P>
<P>I drove Chippy away from me, hoping he would return to his own family, where 
his education could be carried on according to their ideas.</P>
<P>He flew into a tree, ate the grasshopper which Jill fed to him, and then flew
 on the roof of the porch outside my window, where he sat calling me. Going 
<SPAN class="pagenum"><A name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</A></SPAN> to my 
room I opened the screen to let him in, but this startled him and he flew 
away.</P>
<P>The sun had gone down by this time and I supposed he had at last returned to 
the nest. As I sat at the supper table I heard him calling to me and went 
outside.</P>
<P>He was in a tree in a neighbor's yard, but when he saw me he at once flew
 down on my head, and it was comical to see him try to express his joy.</P>
<P>After that he spent his days among the trees, but at sunset always came to
 the house and slept in a box in my room.</P>
<P>Whenever he was hungry he would come to the window and call for food.</P>
<P>His favorite resting-place was on my shoulder or head and he seemed to be
 very fond of company.</P>
<P>One morning I saw Jack and Jill flying from tree to tree with him and that is 
the last I ever saw of any of them.</P>

<P class="drop-cap">THIS beautiful species is said to be by far the most gentle 
and unsuspicious of our quails, and will permit a very close approach by man, 
showing little or no fear of what most animals know so well to be their most 
deadly enemy. While feeding they keep close together, and constantly utter a 
soft clucking note, as though talking to one another.</P>
<P>This species is about the size of the eastern variety. Its head is ornamented
 with a beautifully full, soft occipital crest. The head of the male is 
singularly striped with black and white. The female is smaller and is quite 
different in color, but may be recognized by the generic characters. The tail is 
short and full, and the claws very large.</P>
<P>The quail makes a simple nest on the ground, under the edge of some old log, 
or in the thick grass on the prairie, lined with soft and well-dried grass and a 
few feathers. From fifteen to twenty-four white eggs are laid. The female sits 
three weeks. The young brood, as soon as they are fairly out of the shell, leave 
the nest and seem abundantly strong to follow the parent, though they are no 
bigger than the end of one's thumb—covered with down. The massena quail is an 
inhabitant of the western and southwestern states.</P>

<DIV><IMG class="drop-cap" alt="" src="3_files/initial_t.jpg"> </DIV>
<P class="drop-cap">THE big orchard on the Triggs place was also the old 
orchard. Grandpa Triggs had planted it long ago in his young days when the 
country was new. The year before he had hauled logs from yonder forest with his 
ox-team and built the strong little house that still stands at the foot of the 
orchard.</P>
<P>He brought young crab trees, too, and set them all about the house and
 though, after the orchard was started, he often threatened to cut them down, he 
never did it and they grew into a tangle of friendship and protection until the 
little one-roomed house was nearly hidden.</P>
<P>The house was desolate now. The catbirds built their nests in the crotches of 
the crabs and the jays came over from the woods across the river and quarreled 
with them. An old zigzag rail fence separated the orchard from the hay-field at 
one end and a tall uncared-for osage hedge did scant duty at two sides. Once in 
a great while a sheep would leave the aftermath and step through the wide spaces
 of the hedge and, entering the doorless house, would walk curiously about and
 then return. But that was all—no, not quite all. The children built fires in
 the great fireplace and roasted potatoes or experimented at cooking carrots,
 artichokes, apples and occasionally a pair of kidneys rolled each in several
 thicknesses of brown paper and slowly cooked under the hot ashes and coals. To 
be sure, the smoke came out into the room and got into the children's eyes and 
passed out at the door—for the chimney had crumbled to half its old time 
height—but the playtimes went on in spite of that and the birds shouted and sang 
outside.</P>
<P>One would expect that all this activity above board to be happily interested
 without looking for new and startling circumstances under ground. But, withal, 
life went on among the "underground <SPAN class="pagenum"><A name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 
161]</A></SPAN> lights," with its busy unconcern of affairs which it could not 
share or even comprehend. Rarely when the fire warmed the bricks about the 
fireplace did comely, plump Mrs. Acre Tidae fail to raise her song. She had a 
way of building a home had Mrs. House Cricket. She tossed out a few grains of 
earth from under the brick tiling of the hearth and presto! she entered in 
backward and sat down waving her long slender antennæ with a happy content that 
would shame many a one who, having more, is not satisfied. Mr. Field Cricket, 
who happens also to be named Acre Tidae, had built his home at the edge of the 
path in the sandy loam just without the door. Two bodies of the same name and
 family would be expected to live in the same house, but they couldn't quite
 come to do that on account of tastes. For one thing they differed in the matter 
of dress, though that was the least objection one to the other. Mrs. House 
Cricket wore a grayish yellow dress, marked a little with brown and Mr. Field 
Cricket wore darker colors. He built his home deeper, too, which would never 
suit Mrs. Acre Tidae at all. Sometimes his home is twelve inches deep, and six 
it is sure to be. And then, big fellow that he is, quite a bit larger than she, 
he does not mind the cold. He snuggles down in the deep darkness as soon as he 
sees the dew frozen in the tiny crystals all over the long grass blades, and 
sleeps the time away, however long and cold the winter may be; and such a life 
is scorned by bright Mrs. House Cricket, who chooses the hearth on account of
 the warmth and who chirps joyfully throughout the year, except when the fire 
goes out, as it often does in the little old log house; for there were days and 
days when the children did not come to play. At such times Mrs. House Cricket 
was forced unwillingly to fall asleep. "Shameful!" she would mutter, as the last 
flicker of feeling departed. "Such a waste of time. If I had built in a bakery 
or by a brick oven how much busier I might be—and happier. I'm no better than 
those cousins of mine who make it a business to sleep half the year around." 
These last words were so soft as she scraped them off on the ridges of her wing 
covers that the children, who were just going home, stopped and Linsey said, "Do 
hear the cricket—it says, 'Good night; good night.'"</P>
<P>"By-by, Crick!" called Harry, as he leaped through the hedge and ran to the 
brook to stamp on the thin ice with his heel. "I shall move out," moaned Mrs. 
Cricket with her faintest note. But moving day did not arrive for many weeks and 
Mrs. Cricket awoke and went to sleep as many times; and finally the long hot 
days found her contentedly basking in the field among the warm grasses, having 
forgotten the troubles of the winter. "Dear me," she was softly drumming with 
her wing covers as she stopped in her evening search for food. "Dear, dear! how 
that big cousin of mine does scream! Perhaps he calls it music, but I 
don't."</P>
<P>She crept along slowly and hid in a fold of rain-worn paper near the home of 
her much criticized relative. He was sitting in his doorway singing his evening 
song as loud as he could, for he was singing with a purpose. The source of his 
music lay within his wing covers. Nearly one hundred and thirty fine ridges were 
on the under side of one wing cover (which is hard and horny), and these are 
hastily scraped over a smooth nervure which projects from the under side of the 
other wing cover. And that is how he sings. His song is bound to be a love-song 
and Mrs. House Cricket finding a few crumbs within the paper and deciding to 
stay all night suddenly heard the loud, harsh tones softened and, looking out, 
she saw her big cousin standing close to another dark form like his own. He was 
crooning softly as he caressed her with his slender, delicate antennæ—his mate, 
whom he had won to himself with his song. Mrs. House Cricket looked on for a 
moment and changed her mind about staying all night. "I'll creep under a leaf," 
she said, "and leave the lovers to themselves." So she slipped away and saw them 
no more until, some weeks later, she passed and, seeing her cousin in his door,
 stopped:</P>
<P>"I have all my eggs laid," she said, <SPAN class="pagenum"><A name="Page_162" 
id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</A></SPAN> "and I'm going up toward the big house to stay 
until the weather gets cold."</P>
<P>"Mrs. Field Cricket has two hundred eggs right here under this long grass,"
 he answered with great pride. "She is welcome," returned his cousin; "for my 
part I prefer quality to quantity." And she turned away to take a peep at the 
nursery which was warmed and nourished only by the sun.</P>
<P>"They will soon hatch out and dig homes each for himself like my own little 
ones," she said as she left them and began her long journey toward the
 farmhouse. "But mine will be wise enough to get near to a barn or house when 
they are grown up," she mused, "so that they need not sleep all winter, and they 
can be busy and useful to the world—busy, useful, cheerful, hopeful." She 
stopped to say one or the other of these good words often as she traveled on and 
sometimes she said them all at one time, as she pruned her wings which when 
folded, extended beyond her body into long, slender filaments like the 
antennæ.</P>
<P>At length, just as the maple leaves, all brown and dry, were blowing into
 heaps against the rosebushes and the lilacs, Mrs. Acre Tidae reached the
 farmhouse and slipped unobserved into the warm, clean kitchen.</P>
<P>She found a wide crack in the floor near the big chimney and squeezed in,
 digging it out to suit her body.</P>
<P>"The babies are all safe in their little holes by this time," she said, "safe 
for the winter. Perhaps by next fall they will be with me and we will all go out
 at night to eat crumbs," and she began singing, "Useful, cheerful—busy, 
hopeful." "Do hear the cricket," said Linsey, "It sounds like the one in the old 
log house."</P>
<P>"They are all alike, I guess," returned Harry, who was eating apples. "They
 are always jolly sad, I reckon." "Use-ful, cheer-ful, hope-ful," sang Mrs. 
Cricket.</P>

<P class="drop-cap">M. LEPINAY, the presiding genius of the bird hospital in
 Paris, has found by experience that his feathered patients chiefly exhibit a 
tendency toward apoplexy—the dove is particularly addicted to this complaint; 
consumption follows in order of unpopularity, with internal complaints occupying 
the third place. In the case of apoplexy, blood-letting—so popular a remedy in 
the days of our great-grandparents—is resorted to by means of a diminutive
 lancet inserted in a fleshy portion of the bird, and this is followed by small
 doses of such drugs as quinine, bromide of camphor, etc.</P>
<P>Apropos of dog's teeth, about a year ago there was exhibited at a certain
 show a very interesting and aged schipperke, who was at that time the only dog 
in the world boasting a complete set of false teeth. His owner, Mr. Moseley, is 
a dentist as well as a lover of animals, and it is entirely due to his skill 
that the little dog is able to eat with perfect comfort by the aid of the 
artificial molars provided for him by his master, who, on another occasion, 
provided a dog who had lost a limb in an accident with an artificial leg. The 
only horse possessing a full set of false teeth was the property of Mr. Henry 
Lloyd of Louisville, Ky., who had its diseased teeth extracted and replaced by a 
set of false ones.</P>
<P>A swan that had had a leg run over by a cart-wheel, causing a compound
 fracture, was recently successfully treated at Otley, England, while yet
 another swan had an operation performed at Darlington some little time ago that 
was very much out of the ordinary. In this instance, the unlucky bird had the 
principal bone in its right wing fractured in several places, the fracture 
presumably being caused by a brutal blow dealt by some unknown ruffian. A 
veterinary surgeon was asked to give his advice, and on his recommendation an 
amputation was decided upon, and this he successfully performed. The bird, sans 
a wing, was, when last heard of, well on the road to recovery.</P>

<P class="drop-cap">MATTER <I>per se</I> is an evidence of mind. Every material 
thing enshrines a thought. Essential nature has no superfluities. To the thinker 
everything means something. In nature nothing happens. Everything is ordered. 
There can be no portrait of a landscape without a painter. There can be no 
landscape without a maker.</P>
<P>The visible forms that nature takes may be changed. Her invisible forms are 
changeless. The search for the changeless is the great and delightful task of 
art, literature, science, philosophy and religion. The ultimate in nature and in 
art is divine. The permanent principle survives the fleeting form. Nature's 
principles are relatively few. Her forms are multifarious. Tree life is true 
life. It is natural. It is therefore true. Nature's garb may be odd. It may even 
be deformed. But her inner self is never false. Sap, fiber, leaf, blossom, 
fruit; this is nature's apocalypse. It is Queen Beauty's progressive
 revelation.</P>
<P>Trees usually grow singly. Under certain conditions they may as naturally 
grow otherwise. The unusual is not necessarily the unnatural. Nature's resources 
are vast. She may at any time manifest herself in an unfamiliar form.</P>
<P>A triplet tree grows on what is known as "Green's Ranch" in Cowley County, 
Kansas. The ranch is located five miles northeast of Arkansas City. The trees 
are about three hundred yards from the west bank of the Walnut River. They range 
in a line running north and south. They are between forty-five and fifty feet 
high. The first two on the north are eighteen inches apart. The third tree 
standing at the south end of the row is fifteen feet from the middle one. They 
are water elms, and average about three and one-half feet in girth. The tree
 standing at the north end of the row is hollow at the base and, leaning over
 southward intersects the central tree two feet from the ground; thence it 
extends to the one at the south end of the row, and intersects it with a limb
 from either side twelve feet above the ground. The segment of the circle
 described by the leaning tree is about twenty feet. At the points where the
 cross tree intersects the other two, it is not merely a case of contiguity, but 
of actual identification.</P>
<P>Another feature of the leaning tree is that half way between its base and the 
trunk of the second, and on the lower side is an unsightly knot about as large 
as a half bushel measure. Half way between the center tree and the one on the 
south, and on the under side of the leaning tree is another lump similar to the 
first, about half the size. These unsightly warts appear to have been produced 
by a congestion of sap in the tissue of the intersecting tree. This triplet tree 
is a curiosity. It presents a strange phenomenon in tree formation. But nature 
is everywhere full of mystery and surprises.</P>

<P class="drop-cap">ANYONE who has traveled through the comparatively treeless
 countries around the Mediterranean, such as Spain, Sicily, Greece, northern 
Africa, and large portions of Italy, must fervently pray that our own country 
may be preserved from so dismal a fate, says President Charles W. Eliot. It is 
not the loss of the forests only that is to be dreaded, but the loss of 
agricultural regions now fertile and populous, which may be desolated by the 
floods that rush down from the bare hills <SPAN class="pagenum"><A name="Page_164" 
id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</A></SPAN> and mountains, bringing with them vast 
quantities of sand and gravel to be spread over the lowlands.</P>
<P>Traveling a few years ago through Tunisie, I came suddenly upon a fine Roman 
bridge of stone over a wide, bare, dry river bed. It stood some thirty feet 
above the bed of the river and had once served the needs of a prosperous 
population. Marveling at the height of the bridge above the ground, I asked the 
French station master if the river ever rose to the arches which carried the 
roadway of the bridge. His answer testified to the flooding capacity of the 
river and to the strength of the bridge. He said: "I have been here four years,
 and three times I have seen the river running over the parapets of that bridge. 
That country was once one of the richest granaries of the Roman empire. It now 
yields a scanty support for a sparse and semi-barbarous population." The whole 
region round-about is treeless. The care of the national forests is a provision 
for future generations, for the permanence over vast areas of our country of the
 great industries of agriculture and mining upon which the prosperity of the 
country ultimately depends. A good forest administration would soon support 
itself.—<I>From January Atlantic.</I></P>

<P class="drop-cap">A LATE season snowstorm, with the heavy precipitation that
 marked the storm of Feb. 28, gives the heart of the sportsman as well as that 
of the bird protector a touch of anxiety on the score of the ruffed grouse and 
quail. A downfall of that kind, followed by a thaw and then by a freeze at 
night, means the death of hundreds of game birds. The quail simply get starved
 and cold killed, while the ruffed grouse, or partridges, get locked up by Jack 
Frost and die of hunger in their prisons.</P>
<P>There is a patch of woods not far from Delavan, Wis., where there was until 
recently an abundance of these game birds. There was a local snowstorm there 
late in February last year, which was followed by a day of sunshine and then by 
a frost which covered the snow with a heavy crust. Grouse have a habit of 
escaping from the cold and blustering winds by burying themselves in the big 
snow drifts at the edges of the woods. There they lie snug and warm and are 
perhaps loath to leave their comfortable quarters. They sometimes stay in the
 drift until the delay costs them their lives, the crust forming and walling
 them in. It so happened to sixteen partridges in the woodland patch near
 Delavan. With the melting of the season's snows the bodies of the birds were 
found. They were separated from one another by only a few feet. It was a 
veritable grouse graveyard.—<I>Tribune.</I></P>

<P class="drop-cap">THIS duck has many popular synonyms, among others 
ring-necked, ring-billed shuffler, ring-necked scaup duck, or blue-bill fall 
duck (Minnesota), black jack (Illinois), moon-bill (South Carolina). It is found 
throughout the whole of North America, south to Guatemala and the West Indies; 
breeding from Iowa, southern Wisconsin, Minnesota and Maine northward. It is 
accidental in Europe.</P>
<P>The chief variation in the plumage of this species consists in the 
distinctness of the chestnut collar in the male, which is usually well defined, 
particularly in front. There is very little in its habits to distinguish it from 
the other "black-heads." Like them, it usually associates in small flocks. Its 
flesh is excellent, being fat, tender and juicy.</P>

<P class="drop-cap">WRENS are famous for choosing queer places for 
nesting-sites. They will nest in almost any situation about the house or yard 
that can be entered through any semblance of a hole. I place all kinds of odd 
receptacles about the yard for them every spring, which they seldom fail to 
occupy. These friendly and interesting little creatures appreciate such 
thoughtfulness, and repay it by fairly bubbling over with grateful song.</P>
<P>But the pair that afforded me the most amusement pre-empted a homestead that 
was not intended for them.</P>
<P>Our acquaintance began when preparing to remove the cook stove to the summer 
kitchen in May. In winter this kitchen is used as a sort of lumber room, and 
when clearing it of various odd and ends it was found that a pair of wrens had 
taken possession of an overshoe and laid the foundation of a home. The pair of 
overshoes had been tied together and hung on a nail in the wall, about five feet 
from the floor.</P>
<P>Needless to say they were left undisturbed, though not without many doubts of 
the feasibility of the enterprise, on account of the proximity of the stove. The 
shoes were the ordinary kind, fleece-lined rubber, and were only a few feet from 
where the stove would be set. These conditions warranted the expectation of 
disastrous results from extreme heat—at least so it seemed to me, but my little 
neighbors thought otherwise, and nest-building progressed rapidly. Being
 remarkably industrious midgets, the nest of sticks was soon finished and lined 
with soft feathers from the poultry yard.</P>
<P>Wrens are noted for their industry; unless in a very restricted situation the 
outside dimensions of the nest are enormous when compared with the interior, or 
cavity. And the twigs that compose the structure are out of all proportion to 
the size of the architects. I have seen twigs a foot long and half the size of a 
lead pencil, used in the construction of their nests. That birds so diminutive 
could carry such burdens in their tiny bills is indeed wonderful. It is said 
that a single pair have been known to fill a barrel, but no nest quite so 
mammoth as this has ever come under my observation.</P>
<P>To return to the home in the shoes. After the completion of the nest five wee 
eggs were deposited therein, and <SPAN class="pagenum"><A name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 
168]</A></SPAN> incubation began. And in spite of the heat everything went on 
happily in this unique domicile.</P>
<P>We soon became the most sociable friends. Their quaint and charming ways made 
them very amusing pets. They became so tame that they would approach me 
fearlessly, even alighting on my head, and would let me examine their nest 
without being frightened.</P>
<P>The wren is a very lively and active bird, and sings incessantly throughout
 the breeding-season, and these were not an exception, but were forever darting 
in and out, their actions accompanied by a sweet warble. Mr. Wren would 
positively quiver all over with delight, while regaling Mrs. Wren and me with 
his exuberant melody. They were the cheeriest little companions imaginable. 
Every morning as I entered the kitchen I was greeted heartily by my small 
neighbors, who bustled about in the preparation of the morning meal as busily as 
I. Meanwhile Mr. Wren merrily sang his innocent matin song, and spontaneously I 
would find myself singing too, as I went about my work.</P>
<P>One day there was great excitement in the shoe and, when I looked in, five
 featherless mites with huge mouths were to be seen. Mrs. Wren was now a 
veritable "old woman who lived in a shoe." But she did not treat her children as 
did the old woman of nursery fame, though she was kept very busy in supplying 
their wants, even with the assistance of Mr. Wren.</P>
<P>These birds subsist on small insects and consume a considerable quantity.
 With much satisfaction I watched them slay a host of ants that were invading
 the kitchen; running up and down the wall with much agility, they picked the 
ants off.</P>
<P>Real warm weather had set in by the time the nestlings were ready to try
 their wings, and I thought, of course, my friends would desert me for a cooler 
resort out of doors, in which to pass the heated term. But O, no, they were too 
loyal for that, so to make their house more commodious, another room was added 
by building a nest in the other shoe. And the family raised in the second shoe 
was not a whit less interesting than the first.</P>

<P class="ac">CHARLES C. MARBLE.</P>
<P>Vice often epitomizes ancestry.</P>
<P>The wisest are not so wise as silence.</P>
<P>Experience is the grave of enthusiasm.</P>
<P>Experience is the enemy of dogmatism.</P>
<P>Our faith is often nothing more than our hope.</P>
<P>Should we despise anything that God has made?</P>
<P>In bestowing benefits we imperil friendship.</P>
<P>Innocence and guilt are alike suffused with blushes.</P>
<P>If vice did not exist wisdom could not predicate itself.</P>
<P>Disappointment leaves a scar which hope cannot remove.</P>
<P>Success is an excellent proof of the wisdom which achieved it.</P>
<P>The vices of some men are more endurable than the virtues of others.</P>
<P>Beauty is a reproach without virtue, while virtue is itself the highest
 beauty.</P>
<P>The sun at noon gives no more light than at morn, but its glow has more
 warmth and power.</P>
<P>Without the accessories life were of little worth, and hope gives it its 
permanence and serenity.</P>
<P>Marriage should be in harmony with nature, in which what is seemingly 
discordant but illuminates and purifies it.</P>
<P>Our conduct toward one another should be based upon a conception of the 
infinite mischances of life and the exquisite poignancy of regret.</P>
<P>Misfortune seeks consolation in communicating itself. But when it no longer 
needs sympathy it is silent, and ashamed of its former volubility.</P>
<P>We can overcome even our prejudices where some interest is subserved by it. 
So much stronger is self-interest than color, social status, or education.</P>
<P>The poet should know, better than another, his limitations. Parnassus is
 always higher than our dreams, and his summit more radiant than the vision of 
any mortal.</P>
<P>The lily of the valley, which hides its chaste head in dewy leaflets, is a
 thousand times less modest than the maiden whose conscious blush reveals the 
innocence of reason.</P>
<P>If we were to judge all men by what they seem to have achieved, we would be 
harsh and unjust. We cannot always see the scar left by a heroic deed, and
 modesty conceals it.</P>
<P>Complete benevolence implies simplicity of living. The Christian cannot have 
if he knows that others have not. Thoreau was perhaps the wisest man of his 
time; he practiced what he preached; and there are few examples of simplicity to 
compare with his.</P>
<P>Nothing, perhaps, is more humiliating than to observe the precocious
 development of the negative virtues, especially prudence. There is a subtle
 suspiciousness in early prudence which is at war with all generous impulses.
 Think of the pinched heart of a little miser.</P>
<P>There is a selfishness which deals generously with its own: my wife, my child 
shall be arrayed in the richest, shall feed upon the daintiest; my servant, my 
handmaid they are naught to me. Nature hath made nothing better than my desert; 
she hath made nothing poor enough for thee and thine.</P>
<P>In an old man conceit may be so comprehensive as to include the race. Has he 
been reasonably successful with the fair sex, all are the subjects of his whim 
or desire; and he will sententiously and confidently repel any claim of virtue 
or purity. So blind is he to the centuries made splendid by her virtue and 
self-sacrifice, and so little is his judgment affected by objects unconnected
 with self.</P>

<DIV class="verse">Pan through the pastures often times hath runne</DIV>
<DIV class="verse">To plucke the speckled fox-gloves from their stems.</DIV>
<DIV class="verse ar">—<I>W. Browne, Britannias Pastorals, II. 
4.</I></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<DIV class="p2"><IMG class="drop-cap" alt="" src="3_files/initial_t.jpg"> </DIV>
<P class="drop-cap">THE fox-glove is a biennial herb from two to seven feet in 
height with a solitary, sparingly branched stem. The basal leaves are very large 
and broad, gradually becoming narrower and smaller toward the apex of the stem 
and its branches, dark green in color, pubescent, margin dentate, venation very
 prominent. The inflorescence is very characteristic. The large, numerous
 flowers are closely crowded and pendulous from one side of the arched stalk.
 The corolla is purple and spotted on the inside. It is a very handsome plant, 
widely distributed, preferring a sandy or gravelly soil in open woods. When 
abundant and in full bloom it makes a beautiful exhibit. It is a garden favorite 
in many lands.</P>
<P>This plant is apparently not mentioned in the works of older authors. It was 
not known to the ancient Greeks and Romans. It was, however, used medicinally in 
the northern countries of Europe since very remote times. The Anglo-Saxon word 
fox-glove is derived from the Welsh (11th century), <I>foxes-glew</I>, meaning 
fox music in allusion to an ancient musical instrument consisting of bells hung 
on an arched support. In the Scandinavian idioms the plant bears the name of 
foxes' bells. The German name <I>Fingerhut</I>, meaning finger hat, hence 
thimble, is derived from the resemblance of the flower to a thimble. Still more 
poetical is the name <I>Wald-glöcklein</I>, meaning little forest bells, in 
reference to the inflorescence. In England the flowers are known as foxes' 
fingers, ladies' fingers and dead men's bells.</P>
<P>According to an old English work on medicine the early physicians of Wales 
and England applied this drug externally only. It was not until 1775 when the 
English physician Withering began to use it internally, especially in the 
treatment of hydrophobia. Modern physicians consider digitalis one of the most 
important medicinal plants. It is a very powerful, hence very poisonous drug, 
its action being due to an active principle known as <I>digitalin</I>. Its
 principal use is in the treatment of deficient heart action due to various
 causes but especially when due to valvular lesions. The physician must, 
however, observe great care in its administration, not only because of its 
powerful action but also because of its "cumulative action;" that is, the effect 
of the drug increases although only normal medicinal doses are given at regular
 intervals, so that fatal poisoning may result, especially if the patient should
 attempt to rise suddenly. The physician guards against this by gradually
 decreasing the dose or by discontinuing it for a time and by requiring the
 patient to remain in a recumbent position while under the influence of the
 drug.</P>
<P>For medicinal use the leaves from the wild-growing plants are preferred
 because they contain more of the active principle. The leaves are collected
 when about half of the flowers are expanded and, since it is a biennial, that
 would be during the second year. The first year leaves are, however, often used 
or added. Like all valuable drugs it is often adulterated, the leaves of 
<I>Inula Conyza</I> (ploughman's spikenard), <I>Symphytum officinale</I> 
(comfrey), and <I>Verbascum Thapsus</I> (mullein) being used for that purpose. 
The odor of the bruised green leaves is heavy or nauseous, while that of the 
dried leaves is fragrant, resembling the odor of tea. <SPAN class="pagenum"><A 
name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</A></SPAN> The taste is quite bitter. 
Formerly the roots, flowers and seeds were also used medicinally.</P>

<P class="drop-cap">THE Agricultural Department at Washington is taking 
precautions to prevent the importation into the United States of any of the 
animal pests which are found in Porto Rico, the Philippines, and the other new 
colonies. Among these none is more feared than the great fruit bats which abound 
in the Philippines. A full grown specimen of the fruit bat measures five feet 
from tip to tip of its wings. The fruit bats live together in immense 
communities and feed almost altogether on tropical and subtropical fruits. They 
crowd together so thickly on the trees that sometimes large branches are broken 
down by their weight. In Australia they have increased so rapidly that great 
sums of money have been spent in their destruction, one organized movement of 
the fruit growers of New South Wales recently resulting in the killing of 
100,000 bats at a cost of 30 cents each. Another possible immigrant which is
 much dreaded is the mongoose, which abounds in Cuba, Porto Rico, and the other 
West Indian Islands. The mongoose was first brought to the islands for the 
purpose of destroying the rats and mice, which it did so thoroughly that it was 
soon forced to adapt itself to another diet. It was found that the mongoose 
thrived on young poultry, birds, and even young pigs and lambs, while it also 
consumed great quantities of pineapples, bananas, corn and other vegetable 
products.</P>

<P class="drop-cap">CAPTAIN E. MOSS of the Transvaal tells the following story 
of the monkeys who work for him in the mines: "I have twenty-four monkeys," said 
he, "employed about my mines. They do the work of seven able-bodied men. In many 
instances they lend valuable aid where a man is useless. They gather up the
 small pieces of quartz that would be passed unnoticed by the workingmen, and 
pile them up in little heaps that can easily be gathered up in a shovel and 
thrown into a mill. They work just as they please, sometimes going down into the 
mines when they have cleared up all the débris on the outside. They live and 
work together without quarreling any more than men do. They are quite methodical 
in their habits, and go to work and finish up in the same manner as human beings
 would do under similar circumstances. It is very interesting to watch them at
 their labor, and see how carefully they look after every detail of the work 
they attempt. They clean up about the mines, follow the wheelbarrows and carts 
used in mining and pick up everything that falls off on the way."—<I>Tit

<P class="ac">ANNE WAKELY JACKSON.</P>
<DIV><IMG class="drop-cap" alt="" src="3_files/initial_m.jpg"> </DIV>
<P class="drop-cap">MUCH has been written, and more has been said, in regard to 
the "prevention of cruelty to children," and the "prevention of cruelty to 
animals;" but has anyone ever urged upon the public the prevention of cruelty to 
<I>trees</I>?</P>
<P>It is time someone did, for people nowadays seem to have no regard whatever 
for a tree's feelings, but saw and hack a limb off here or there at any season 
of the year the notion happens to seize them, and leave the poor thing maimed 
and disfigured, and perhaps pouring out its life-blood from the ugly wound.</P>
<P>If you are insensible to the beauty, the blessing and benignity of trees,
 there is no use in appealing to you. But surely you are not! Surely you can 
call to mind some old tree that brings up memories of the past, and appeals to 
you with almost human tenderness!</P>
<P>Then, for the sake of these old, tried, and well-beloved friends, look with
 compassion upon all trees, and discourage those who would spoil and disfigure
 them.</P>
<P>Have you ever thought how sad a tree must feel when it is transplanted from 
the forest to the city or town? How it must miss its tall and stalwart
 companions the shy woodland birds, and the flowers that spring up around it 
each year! The parting from them all is bad enough, but there is worse to come. 
It little dreams of the hideous and deforming "trimming" that will begin as soon 
as it commences to spread its tiny branches! Poor little tree! I wonder it does 
not die of grief and pain!</P>
<P>Doubtless, it sighs and sobs out its longing for the old free home, in the
 ears of the passing wind, though we are too dull to understand its murmuring
 voice.</P>
<P>If the wind is in a good humor, he caresses it gently, and tries to comfort
 it; but sometimes he is angry, and then he shakes the poor tree fiercely. But 
it loves him always, whether he is gentle or rough.</P>
<P>I suppose it is sometimes necessary to trim trees. I hear people say so. But 
I think a tree of beautiful and perfect shape is more desirable than the little 
patch of lawn that might be gained by "trimming it up."</P>
<P>Ought not one to consider, and carefully study the tree, as a whole, before
 venturing to remove any of its branches? To examine it from every point of
 view? Above all, if your trees <I>must</I> be trimmed, see about it 
<I>yourself</I>, and don't trust them to the ruthless hands of people insensible 
to beauty—those to whom a tree is only so much wood! And be very sure your 
"cause" is "justifiable" before you allow them to be touched.</P>
<P>Remember that the finest trees are of slow growth; and if ever you are
 tempted to cut down a really fine one, just stop a moment and reflect that it
 may take half a lifetime to replace it.</P>
<P>If these people who have a mania for cutting down trees could but be
 persuaded to plant a new one for every old one they sacrifice, what a blessing
 it would be to future generations!</P>

<P class="drop-cap">ONE of the most remarkable growths in the government
 botanical gardens is the so-called barber plant, the leaves of which are used 
in some parts of the East by rubbing on the face to keep the beard from growing. 
It is not supposed to have any effect on a beard that is already rooted, but 
merely to act as a preventive, boys employing it to keep the hair from getting a 
start on their faces. It is also employed by some Oriental people who desire to
 keep a part of their heads free from hair, as a matter of fashion. A curious
 looking tree from the Isthmus of Panama bears a round red fruit as big as an 
apple, which has this remarkable faculty, that its juice rubbed on tough beef or 
chicken makes the meat tender by the chemical power it possesses to separate the 
flesh fiber. One is interested to observe in the botanical green houses three 
kinds of plants that have real consumption of the lungs—the leaves, of course, 
being the lungs of a plant. The disease is manifested by the turning of the 
leaves from green to white, the affection gradually spreading from one spot 
until, when a leaf is all white, it is just about to die. Cruelly enough, as it 
would seem, the gardeners only try to perpetuate the disease for the sake of 
beauty and curiosity, all plants of those varieties that are too healthy being 
thrown away.</P>

<P class="drop-cap">THE kea is an outlaw bird of New Zealand for each of whose 
bills the government offers a reward of a shilling. The kea is a gourmand. It 
prefers the kidney of a sheep to any other part of the beast.</P>
<P>Coming down out of the mountains in winter, it attacks the sheep, alighting
 on their backs, and tearing away the hide and flesh until it reaches the
 titbits which it seeks.</P>
<P>How the birds learned to tear away the skin to get at the flesh forms a
 curious story of the development of bird knowledge. The birds had been feeding 
on the refuse of cattle and sheep killed for human consumption. They learned to 
associate the idea of meat with the living animal, and now they kill the sheep 
for the meat without waiting for human aid or consent.</P>
<P>The Maoris have a legend about this bird to the effect that it used to be a
 strict vegetarian, building its nest on the ground. The sheep came and trampled 
on the nests, and the birds attacked them furiously, drawing blood.</P>
<P>They liked the flavor of flesh, and have ever since been eating it. The bird 
builds its nest in trees now, out of the reach of the sheep's hoofs.</P>

<P class="drop-cap">THE true lover of flowers, though he may be enraptured by 
those under cultivation, finds a greater satisfaction in the study and
 observation of those that are developed only under the influence of Nature's
 laws. In the field, the forest, and even in the sea there are plants not only
 pleasing to the eye, but that are doubly interesting because of the wonderful
 provision made for them to assure their survival. Plants, like animals, have
 their enemies, and sometimes it seems that, with thoughtful care for its own
 protection, a species will gradually change its habits, thus conveying a sense 
of danger to its descendants.</P>
<P>Many of the peculiarities of plants, that fit them for existence, may be
 readily studied by the novice in botany as he tramps the fields in search of
 recreation. There is nothing more delightful and charming to the botanist than 
to seek the reasons for the beauties in Nature and to find why plants live and 
exist as they do.</P>
<P>Many delicate plants seek the shelter and protection of the borders of the
 forest. They do not penetrate far within, but remain near the open, where the 
sunlight can reach them. The blood-root (<I>Sanguinaria Canadensis</I>) is of 
this character. Beautiful and delicate, it seems to shun the storm and wind and 
to retire from the gaze of man.</P>
<P>The blood-root belongs to the poppy family (<I>Papaveraceæ</I>), which 
includes about twenty-five genera and over two hundred species. These, though 
widely distributed, are chiefly found in the temperate regions of the North. To
 this family also belong the valuable opium-producing plant (<I>Papaver 
somniferum</I>), the Mexican or prickly poppy (<I>Argemone Mexicana</I>), the 
Dutchman's breeches (<I>Bicuculla Cucullaria</I>), the bleeding-heart 
(<I>Bicuculla eximia</I>) and the beautiful mountain fringe (<I>Adlumia
 fungosa</I>). A large number of the species are cultivated for ornamental
 purposes. The poppy is also cultivated for the commercial value of the opium it 
produces. All the species produce a milky or colored juice. Here, indeed, we may 
say that behind beauty there lurks a deadly foe, for the juice of nearly all the 
species has active narcotic properties. This property is a means of protection 
to the plant under consideration, for its acrid taste is distasteful to 
animals.</P>
<P>The red juice that exudes from all parts of the plant of the blood-root gives 
it both its common and its generic names, the latter, <I>Sanguinaria</I>, is 
derived from the Latin word <I>sanguis</I>, or blood.</P>
<P>This interesting plant is a native of Eastern North America, deriving its
 specific name from the fact that it is found in Canada. It blossoms in April or 
May. Usually but a single flower is borne by the naked stalk that rises from the 
underground stem to the height of about eight inches. The flowers are white, 
very rarely pinkish, about one and one-half of an inch in diameter. The number 
of petals varies from eight to twelve, and they fall very soon after expansion. 
The sepals disappear before the bud opens.</P>
<P>A single leaf is produced from each bud of the underground stem. It is
 wrapped around the flower-bud as the latter rises from the soil and does not
 develop to full size till after the period of blossoming is over. The necessary 
<SPAN class="pagenum"><A name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</A></SPAN> food 
material for the production of the flower was stored in the underground stem 
during the preceding season. Thus the green leaf is not needed early in the 
growth of the plant.</P>
<P>The adult leaf is kidney-shaped, smooth, and five to nine lobed. When fully 
grown they are often more than six inches in diameter. The leaf-stalk, which may 
be over one foot in length, and the radiating veins vary in color from yellowish 
to orange. Few leaves are more beautiful and graceful than these, both during 
their development and when fully mature.</P>
<P>It is said that the Indians formerly used the juice of this plant as a dye,
 and thus it is sometimes called red Indian paint and red puccoon.</P>

<P class="drop-cap">MANY of our garden herbs still in common use for purposes of
 seasoning are in reality British plants, says Longman's Magazine. Among them 
may be mentioned mint and marjoram and thyme and calamint, all of which may be 
found in their native haunts. Fennel is abundant on sea cliffs in many places in 
the south of England. Wild hyssop is perfectly naturalized on the picturesque
 ruins of Beaulieu Abbey and wild balm used to be found within the ancient walls 
of Portchester castle. The garden parsley was formerly abundant on the shingly 
beach at Hurst castle, where it used to be gathered for domestic purposes. One 
native herb, however, much in use among our fore-fathers is now seldom seen in 
kitchen gardens—we mean <I>Tanacetum vulgare</I>, the common tansy, the dull 
yellow flowers of which are often conspicuous by the side of streams. The young
 leaves and juice of this plant were formerly employed to give color and flavor 
to puddings, which were known as tansy cakes, or tansy puddings.</P>
<P>In mediæval times the use of these cakes was specially associated with the
 season of Easter and it is interesting to notice that in the diet rolls of St.
 Swithin's monastery at Winchester, which belong to the end of the fifteenth
 century, we come across the entry "tansey tarte." It has been said that the use 
of tansy cakes at this season was to strengthen the digestion after what an old 
writer calls "the idle conceit of eating fish and pulse for forty days in Lent," 
and it is certain that this was the virtue attributed to the plant by the old 
herbalists. "The herb fried with eggs which is called a 'tansy,'" says 
Culpepper, "helps to digest and carry away those bad humors that trouble the 
stomach." It seems more probable that the custom of eating tansy cakes at Easter 
time was associated with the teaching of that festival, the name "tansy" being a 
corruption of a Greek word meaning "immortality."</P>

<DIV><IMG class="drop-cap" alt="" src="3_files/initial_s.jpg"> </DIV>
<P class="drop-cap">SOME few years ago, while living in the village of West 
Grove, Chester County, Pennsylvania, I observed an unusual number of different 
birds in our own immediate yard and garden, nearly all of which built their 
homes within the narrow limits of our property.</P>
<P>Being deeply interested in the bird kingdom, and appreciating their 
friendship and confidence, I carefully watched the progress of their daily
 labors and their respective traits and individual habits. Our buildings 
consisted of a house, small stable and a carpenter shop, and I was much 
gratified to observe so many pretty birds nesting at our very doors.</P>
<P>In the front yard stood three tall pine trees. In one of these a pair of
 black birds made their nest and reared two broods of young. A goldfinch also 
chose one of the lower branches of the same tree, in the forks of which the 
clever little fellow hung a most beautiful cup-shape nest. It appeared to be 
made of various mosses, lichens, and soft materials, closely woven and cemented 
together, and the lining inside consisted of thistle-down. Four pretty eggs were 
deposited in due course and, as far as I know, the young were safely raised and 
departed with their parents in the fall. I had the pleasure of seeing the entire 
family frequently perched on the seed salad stalks in our garden feeding in 
fearless content.</P>
<P>On both sides of the front porch was a lattice covered with woodbine. In the 
top of one of these a robin chose to build her home, and showed remarkable
 tameness during the entire nesting period. On the back porch, also covered with 
woodbine, a pair of chipping sparrows built their nest, a beautiful little piece 
of workmanship, displaying skill and good taste. A happy little family was 
raised here in safety. Not ten feet from the chipping sparrow's nest, we nailed 
up a little wooden box which was tenanted for several years by a pair of house 
wrens, in all probability the same two. These little birds afforded us many 
hours of pleasure watching their cunning ways and listening to their cheery 
song.</P>
<P>In another box raised on a high pole in the garden, we had a pair of purple
 martins for two seasons and they helped to swell the population of our bird 
community. Placed in a hedge row bordering the yard, I observed the nest and 
eggs of a song sparrow, and their happy notes were to be heard all day long. In 
a small briar patch in the corner of the garden a cat bird made her home, and 
became quite tame, raising four little ones successfully. In the eaves of the 
shop (although not wanted or cherished) the English sparrows held sway and we
 destroyed their nests on two or three occasions, as they repeatedly tried to
 drive away some of our other pets.</P>
<P>Summing up we have a total of nine different birds which nested within our
 small domain, and in each instance they seemed to feel a sense of security and 
protection from all harm. In addition to those nesting on our premises, we were 
favored with frequent visits from many more, such as vireos, orioles, cardinals, 
indigo birds, chickadees, nuthatches, snow birds, sparrow hawks, flickers, etc., 
according to the time of year.</P>
<P>Prior to the summer in question, my father had been very ill, and as he was
 then getting better he spent many days on the porch. This afforded ample
 opportunity for him to study our birds, and they in like manner became so 
accustomed to his presence that they were quite fearless. Especially was this 
the case with the chipping sparrows above mentioned. They became unusually tame 
during the season and the mother bird finally ate out of father's hand or would 
sit on the toe of his boot and pick crumbs from his fingers.</P>

<P class="drop-cap">THIS beautiful specimen of the finch family is found in the
 southern United States from the Atlantic to the Pacific, although very local 
and irregularly distributed. It is occasionally found north to Kansas, Illinois, 
Pennsylvania and Connecticut. The male is brilliant blue, darker across the 
middle of the back. The female is yellowish brown above, brownish yellow 
beneath, darkest across the breast, wings broadly edged with brownish yellow. 
Sometimes there is a faint trace of blue on the tail. The young resemble the
 female. Males from the Pacific coast region have tails considerably longer than 
eastern specimens, while those from California are of a much lighter and less 
purplish blue.</P>
<P>The blue grosbeak is a very inconspicuous bird. Unless seen under the most 
favorable circumstances the adult male does not appear to be blue, but of a 
dusky color, and Ridgway says may easily be mistaken for a cow blackbird, unless 
carefully watched; besides they usually sit motionless, in a watchful attitude, 
for a considerable time, and thus easily escape observation.</P>
<P>The blue grosbeak frequents the thickets of shrubs, briars and tall weeds
 lining a stream flowing across a meadow or bordering a field, or the similar
 growth which has sprung up in an old clearing. The usual note is a strong harsh 
<I>ptchick</I>, and the song of the male is a very beautiful, though rather 
feeble, warble. At least two broods are raised during a season.</P>

<P class="drop-cap">IT would seem that nature had provided enough space and a 
sufficient variety of nooks and corners for birds to choose from and build their 
nests in; yet it is a strange fact that many of them often prefer to follow man, 
and select, for their homes, some spot he has planned and made.</P>
<P>In the fields one often sees the nests of robins and blackbirds built between
 the rails of pole fences, and sometimes catbirds choose this situation for a
 home. Around the barns will be found the swallows and their curious nests of 
mud. Then there are those cheerful and always friendly little birds, the wrens, 
which think that our houses are just the homes they would like, too; and any box 
or can, or what is prettiest of all, a miniature cottage placed on a fence, will 
rarely ever remain unoccupied during the summer. Even the shy bluebirds, whose 
sheen of feathers seems to be borrowed from the sky, like to peep into 
these.</P>
<P>Of all the wild birds, I believe I love the wrens the best. They are always
 so busy and yet so companionable. Last spring, when the days began to get warm, 
I left the window of my room open to admit the fresh free air; and on going in 
there one day I spied one of these spry little fellows peeping and hopping 
around the curtains, which were looped up, forming a cozy recess. He did not 
seem to be alarmed at my presence, but calmly went on with his inspection; and 
would you believe it, the next morning the pair of them were busy constructing 
their nest in this nook. I let the window remain open all summer, and they
 raised their family there.</P>
<P>But the strangest of all strange sites in which I ever found a nest was 
nearly at the bottom of a deep well! This well was walled up with rock and a
 couple of brown field birds carried twigs and grass down it and formed their 
nest on a projecting spur of stone. Why they should choose such a location as 
this it is hard to tell.</P>

<P class="drop-cap">THERE are other armies in South Africa besides the Boers and
 the British; armies of very little folk, which go out on foraging expeditions 
when their colonies stand in need of supplies—forays planned and executed with 
military precision, and, as a general thing, uniformly successful.</P>
<P>I speak of an army of ants.</P>
<P>A close observer, residing in South Africa, describes one of these forays in 
the following way:</P>
<P>"The army, which I estimated to number about fifteen thousand ants, started 
from their home in the mud walls of a hut and marched in the direction of a 
small mound of fresh earth, but a few yards distant. The head of the column 
halted on reaching the foot of the mound and waited for the rest of the force to 
arrive at the place of operations, which evidently was to be the mound of fresh 
earth. When the remainder had arrived and halted so that the entire army was 
assembled, a number of ants detached themselves from the main body and began to 
ascend to the top of the mound, while the others began moving so as to encircle 
the base of the mound.</P>
<P>"Very soon a number from the detachment which had ascended the mound, or 
lilliputian kopje, evidently the attacking party, entered the loose earth and 
speedily returned, each bearing a cricket or a young grasshopper, dead, which he 
deposited upon the ground and then returned for a fresh load. Those who had 
remained on the outside of the mound, took up the crickets and grasshoppers as 
they were brought out and bore them down to the base of the hill, returning at 
once for fresh victims. Soon the contents of the mound seemed to be exhausted,
 and then the whole force returned home, each ant carrying his burden of food 
for the community."</P>
<HR class="sect">

<P>My very young readers will be surprised, no doubt, to hear me speak of wasps 
as cement-makers, or paper-makers, but such, in truth, they are. You can form no 
idea of the industry and toil these little folk expend upon the structure they 
call home. Nothing pleases them better than to find an old fence rail covered 
with a light gray fuzz of woody fiber loosened from decaying wood by excessive 
soakings of rain. Dozens of these little pulp-gatherers will descend upon the 
rail, and as fast as each of them obtains a load away he flies to the place 
where the home building is already going on.</P>
<P>This may be in a clump of bushes near a stream, and as fast as they deposit
 their load of fiber down they fly to the stream, and having secured a mouthful 
of water back they go to the nest to beat the fiber into a thin sheet, which 
they deftly join to the main body, the jointure being imperceptible. Such a 
throng of workers coming and going, some to the fence, some to the nest, some to 
the brook, each addition to the structure being the tiniest mite, yet growing 
perceptibly under the united efforts of the little builders.</P>
<P>TAR.—One of the commonest substances met with in city or town is tar. A paper 
roof covered with tar makes a very good protection against sun and rain provided 
a suitable amount of gravel covers the tar. The kind of tar most used is called 
coal-tar or gas-tar. This is made at the gas factory from the distilling of soft 
coal. Tar that comes from different varieties of pine and spruce is used to 
cover ropes and hulls of ships. It is from his having some of it usually 
clinging to his hands and clothes that the sailor boy came to be called "Jack 
Tar," and from his fondness for the sea one of the royal family of England got 
the pet name of "Royal Tarry Breeks." It is strange that there has been no 
change in the work of getting this kind of tar from the wood for over 
twenty-three hundred years. The wood is placed in holes dug in the ground and 
covered carefully with turf so as to keep out the air and prevent too much 
burning. Some of the wood is left free so the air may get at it and burn it 
enough to make heat enough to distil the pitch from the rest <SPAN class="pagenum"><A 
name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</A></SPAN> of it. This is gathered into 
barrels and is black because of the smoke that gets into it. It was this sort of 
tar that Benjamin Franklin had his experience with one time in Philadelphia. He 
was running along on the tops of tar barrels on the wharf one fine day with his
 Sunday clothes on. The head of one barrel was not in good condition, and so 
Benjamin went down into it. The next issue of his paper had a very amusing 
account of the accident in which Franklin used his powers to make puns to great 
advantage in making fun at his own expense.</P>
<P>ANTS.—Would you like to get a clean skeleton of any small animal? Place the 
body near or upon an ant hill and the little workers will clean it off for you 
perfectly, picking every bone as clean as if they were under contract with a 
forfeit for every scrap of flesh, skin, or sinew left upon any bone. They like 
meat so well that they will attack animals that are many times larger than 
themselves and carry the work to a successful end. There are three kinds of ants 
in an ant hill—males, females, and neuters. The males and females have wings and 
do no work to speak of. They are always waited upon very carefully by the 
neuters who have no wings, but are noted for their industry, skill, and 
strength. It has been said that the ant stores up large quantities of grain in 
the summer for winter use. Whoever said that was not well acquainted with his 
subject. In winter the ants neither eat nor work. Some of the neuters have their 
jaws, or mandibles, made much larger than the rest. These are the soldiers, and 
they fight with greater fierceness than any other creatures. Huber, the blind 
naturalist who told the world so many astonishing things about bees, describes a 
great fight he once saw between two colonies of these little warriors. "I shall 
not say what lighted up discord between these two republics, the one as populous 
as the other. The two armies met midway between their respective residences.
 Their serried columns reached from the field of battle to the nest, and were
 two feet in width. The field of battle, which extended over a space of two or
 three square feet, was strewn with dead bodies and wounded; it was also covered 
with venom, and exhaled a penetrating odor. The struggle began between two ants, 
which locked themselves together with their mandibles, while they raised 
themselves upon their legs. They quickly grasped each other so tightly that they 
rolled one over the other in the dust. When night came they stopped fighting, 
but the next morning they went at it again and piled the ground with slain and
 wounded." Their stings hurt because they carry a liquid that is like that found 
in nettles and in the hairs and other parts of certain caterpillars. This is 
called formic acid, and is made by chemists for certain purposes. The red ant 
dislikes to work if he can get slaves to do it for him. Perhaps we should say if 
<I>she</I> can get it done for <I>her</I>, because these neuters are rather more 
like females than like male ants. They make war purposely to get into the homes 
of other colonies to carry away their eggs and baby ants. They bring these up to 
wait upon them. When they go on a journey the slaves have to carry their owners, 
and sometimes they even feed them until they refuse to feed themselves. They 
have been known to die of hunger with plenty of food within easy reach, but with 
no slave at hand to place it before them. In going out to fight for the
 offspring of other ants they go in regular columns, and those that are left 
after the slaughter return home in the same order, their solid trains sometimes
 extending more than a hundred feet. Some ants keep cows. Plant lice have 
honeydew in their bodies, and when well fed they give out a great deal of it. 
Ants are fond of it. They sometimes confine the plant lice, feed them, and milk 
the honeydew from the bodies of their captors. A German scientist named Simon, 
has recently returned from Australia with some great stories about ants. He says 
he suffered much from their attacks. In trying to get rid of them in many ways 
he at last hit upon the idea of spreading a poison where they would have to pass 
across it. He used <SPAN class="pagenum"><A name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 
187]</A></SPAN> prussiate of potash which is sometimes used in photography. 
Another name for it is cyanide of potassium. He says, "How astonished was I when 
I saw the whole surface of the heap strewn with dead ants like a battle-field. 
The piece of cyanide, however, had totally disappeared. More than one-half of 
the community had met death in this desperate struggle, but still the 
death-defying courage of the heroic little creatures had succeeded in removing
 the fatal poison, the touch of which must have been just as disagreeable to
 them as it was dangerous. Recklessly neglecting their own safety, they had
 carried it off little by little, covering every step with a corpse. Once 
removed from the heap, the poison had been well covered with leaves and pieces 
of wood, and thus prevented from doing further damage. The heroism of these 
insects, which far surpasses what any other creature, including even man, has 
ever shown in the way of self-sacrifice and loyalty, had made such an impression 
on me that I gave up my campaign, and henceforth I bore with many an outrage 
from my neighbors rather than destroy the valiant beings whose courage I had not
 been able to crush." In the extreme southwest of the United States are colonies 
of ants that have a peculiar custom of setting apart some of their number to 
give up their lives for their fellows in a strange way. They feed upon honey 
until they are unable to walk. Then their fellows take the greatest care of them 
and feed them so their bodies are distended enormously. A number of these ants 
when fed so highly look very much like a bunch of little grapes, they are so
 round and translucent. When food is scarce later the other ants come to their 
heavy mates and eat them with great relish.</P>
<P>AIR.—The wear and tear in our bodies is replaced by new material carried to 
the spot by the blood. The heart forces the blood out along the arteries in a 
bright red current. It comes back blackened with the refuse material. It passes 
to the lungs, where it comes into contact with the air we breathe. It does not 
quite touch the air, but is acted upon by the air through very thin partitions 
much as the cash business is carried on in some houses and banks with the 
cashiers all placed behind screens, where they may be seen and talked to but not 
reached. Purified in the lungs by contact with fresh air, the blood goes back to 
continue the good work of making the body sound. But if the air has been used 
before by someone in breathing it has become bad and the blood does not get the 
benefit from contact with it in the lungs that nature intended. Ordinarily a man 
breathes in about four thousand gallons of air in a day if he is taking things 
easily, but when he is hard at mental or physical work he needs much more than 
this. Air that has been hurt by being breathed is restored to the right 
condition by the leaves of trees and plants. In large cities where people are 
crowded together there is a lack of good air. But nature is continually rushing 
the air about so that new may take the place of what has been used, rain washes 
it out, and the storm brings in from the country just the kind of air the city 
man needs in his lungs.</P>

<P class="drop-cap">IN INDIA bird-life abounds everywhere absolutely unmolested, 
and the birds are as tame as the fowls in a poultry yard. Ring-doves, minas, 
hoopoes, jays and parrots hardly trouble themselves to hop out of the way of the 
heavy bull-carts, and every wayside pond and lake is alive with ducks, geese, 
pelicans, and flamingoes and waders of every size and sort, from dainty 
beauties, the size of pigeons, up to the great unwieldy cranes and adjutants,
 five feet high.</P>

<P class="drop-cap">THERE is perhaps no feature of Irish scenery more 
characteristic and depressing than the almost universal absence of those tracts 
of woods which in other countries soften the outlines of hills and valleys. The 
traveler gazing on its bald mountains and treeless glens can hardly believe that 
Ireland was at one time covered from shore to shore with magnificent forests. 
One of the ancient names of the country was "The Isle of Woods" and so numerous 
are its place-names derived from the growth of woods, shrubs, groves, oaks,
 etc., that (as Dr. Joyce says) "if a wood were now to spring up in every place
 bearing a name of this kind the country would become clothed with an almost 
uninterrupted succession of forests." On the tops of the barest hills and buried 
in the deepest bogs are to be found the roots, stems and other remains of these 
ancient woods, mostly of oak and pine, some of the bogs being literally full of 
stems, the splinters of which burn like matches.</P>
<P>The destruction of these woods is of comparatively recent date. Cambrensis,
 who accompanied Henry II. into Ireland in the twelfth century, notices the 
enormous quantities of woods everywhere existing. But their extirpation soon 
began with the gradual rise of English supremacy in the land, the object in view 
being mainly to increase the amount or arable land, to deprive the natives of 
shelter, to provide fuel, and to open out the country for military purposes. So 
anxious were the new landlords to destroy the forests that many old leases 
contain clauses coercing tenants to use no other fuel. Many old trees were cut
 down and sold for twelve cents. On a single estate in Kerry, after the 
revolution of 1688, trees were cut down of the value of $100,000. A paper laid
 before the Irish houses of parliament describes the immense quantity of timber 
that in the last years of the seventeenth century was shipped from ports in 
Ulster, and how the great woods in that province (290,000 trees in all) were 
almost destroyed.</P>
<P>The houses passed an act for the planting of 250,000 trees, but it was of no 
avail, and so denuded of timber had the country become that large works started 
in Elizabeth's reign for the smelting of iron were obliged to be stopped at last 
for want of charcoal. The present century has continued the deplorable story of 
destruction. In forty years, from 1841 to 1881, 45,000 acres of timber were cut 
down and sold. Every landlord cut down, scarcely anyone planted, so that at the 
present day there is hardly an eightieth part of Ireland's surface under 
timber.</P>

<P class="drop-cap">FOSSIL remains have been found of birds with teeth and long
 bony tails, and also of reptiles, with wings; great monsters they must have 
been—veritable flying dragons.</P>
<P>In 1861, in the lithographic slates of Solenhofen, Bavaria, a fossil feather
 was found which was the subject of considerable discussion among naturalists.
 Again, in 1862, a curious skeleton was disinterred from the same place, in 
which most of the bones exhibited the marks of a true bird, but the skeleton had 
a most remarkable tail, containing twenty distinct bones. From each of these 
bones proceeded a pair of well-developed feathers, similar to the single feather 
which had been previously found. Here was an animal which could be called a 
birdlike reptile or a lizardlike bird, with equal propriety. Its twenty caudal 
segments or vertebræ were a bar to its entrance to every existing family of 
birds, while it was equally out of place among reptiles.</P>

<P class="drop-cap">THE rock shells or murices are among the most beautiful and
 interesting of all the mollusks or shell fish, and are a favorite among 
collectors. Their peculiar spiny shells and brilliant colors caused them to be 
among the first mollusks studied by naturalists and we find them, therefore, 
described in the earliest works on natural history.</P>
<P>There are about two hundred different kinds of rock shells, mostly confined
 to the tropical and subtropical seas, although a few are found in temperate
 climes. The greatest number of these are found about rocks at low water but not 
a few are inhabitants of waters as deep as fifty fathoms or more. In our own 
country they are abundant along the coast of Panama, the Gulf of California, 
Florida and the islands of the West Indies, but the largest number of varieties 
comes from the Indian Ocean, Japan, the Philippines and Australia. The more
 brightly colored varieties are from tropical seas, while the dull, plain
 species are from subtropical or temperate climes.</P>
<P>The murices are peculiar in having their shells ornamented by numerous
 projections, which vary from long, needle-like spines to simple fluted frills. 
What these spines and frills are for would probably puzzle the ordinary
 observer, as they would seem at first sight to be in the way. In some cases
 they are simply ornamental, but in the main they are protective and enable the 
animal to escape being eaten by some voracious fish. This is known as protective 
adaptation and was probably brought about in this manner: the murices, or their 
ancestors, did not at first have spiny shells, and they fell an easy prey to the 
fishes. As time went on a few individuals, through some modification of 
environment, developed small spines or prominences. The animals having these 
were not eaten by fishes as the knobs and spines caused the fishes pain when 
swallowed, therefore they preferred the animals with smoother shells. In time 
this modification caused a weeding-out process, the animals with smoother shells
 being exterminated and those with spiny shells increasing in numbers and
 becoming more spiny as one generation succeeded another. This continued until 
the present time and is going on even now.</P>
<P>Another interesting fact concerning the development of this ornamentation is 
that the smoother shells inhabit rocky shores where the waves are constantly
 beating in with greater or lesser violence, while the more spiny individuals
 live in protected and comparatively still water. This adds additional weight to 
the theory expressed in the last paragraph, for the fish which feed upon these 
shells do not, as a rule, inhabit localities where the water is rough, as along 
a rocky shore, but live abundantly in protected bays and lagoons in which the 
spiny murices are found.</P>
<P>There are shown on the plate eight species of rock shells, all more or less
 common. The first one for us to consider may be called Venus' Comb, (<I>Murex 
tribulus</I>) and is found in China, Japan and the Indian Ocean. It belongs to a 
group of shells which is characterized by a long snout or canal, and long, 
pointed spines. The color is yellowish; in one variety the spines are tipped 
with black.</P>
<P>A shell which is found on the mantel in every household is known as the
 Branched Rock Shell (<I>Murex ramosus</I>), which is widely distributed, being
 found in the Red Sea, the Indian Ocean, New Zealand, Australia and the Central 
Pacific Ocean, and attains a large size, some specimens reaching the length of a 
foot and weighing several pounds. The aperture is frequently tinged with a deep, 
beautiful <SPAN class="pagenum"><A name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 
192]</A></SPAN> pink. In many households the large shells of this species are 
used for flower pots, suspended from a hook over the window by a set of chains, 
and for this purpose they are certainly very ornamental.</P>
<P>The Apple Murex (<I>Murex pomum</I>) is of home production, being found on
 the shores of Florida and throughout the West Indies. It is not as attractive
 as the shells just mentioned, but is very common, every collector possessing
 several specimens in his cabinet.</P>
<P>In the aperture of this species will be noticed a dark brown object which is 
known as an operculum or door, and its use is to close the aperture when the 
animal withdraws into its shell, so that the latter may be safe from its
 enemies. All of the rock shells possess this organ, which is attached to the 
back part of the animal's foot.</P>
<P>A peculiar and somewhat rare shell is the Horned Murex (<I>Murex 
axicornis</I>), found in the Indian Archipelago, whose shell is made up of many 
curiously fluted spines. The Burnt Murex (<I>Murex adustus</I>), is an 
inhabitant of the Indian Ocean, Japan and the Philippines, and its name, which 
signifies burned, is well chosen, for all its spines and frills and most of the 
shell are black in color and look just as though the shell had been scorched. 
The aperature is often beautifully tinged with pink or dark red.</P>
<P>A common rock shell found in the Mediterranean Sea as well as on the Atlantic 
coast of France and Portugal and the Canary Islands, is the Purple Murex 
(<I>Murex trunculus</I>). This is a light brown, three-banded shell about two 
inches in length and is famous as having been used by the ancients to obtain 
their beautiful and rich purple dye. On the Tyrian shore these shells were 
pounded in caldron-shaped holes in the rocks, and the animals were taken out and 
squeezed for the dye which they secrete. If the animal of one of our common 
purpuras, a small shell found along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, be 
squeezed, it will exude a purple fluid which will stain fabrics a reddish 
purple. It is probable that much or most of the royal purple of the ancients was 
obtained from these lowly creatures.</P>
<P>Although the most beautiful shells of this family are supposed to live in the 
warm, tropical seas of the Indian Ocean, it is nevertheless true that many of 
the most brightly colored rock shells live in the warm waters of Panama and 
Mazatlan. The Root Murex (<I>Murex radix</I>) is one of these shells, which 
attains a length of five inches and weighs several pounds. The shell is white or 
yellowish-white and the spines and frills are jet black, the two colors 
producing a peculiar effect. Another beautiful shell from the same locality 
(Panama) is the Two-colored Murex (<I>Murex bicolor</I>), a shell attaining 
somewhat larger dimensions than the last. The spines are reduced to mere knobs 
in this species, there are but a few frills, and only two colors, the shell 
being greenish-white and the aperture a deep red or pink, plainly showing whence 
the name, bicolor, two-colored. This shell is collected by thousands at Panama 
and shipped all over the United States to curiosity stores at summer watering
 places and other vacation resorts, where they are sold at from a few cents to a 
dollar each, according to quality.</P>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
